# DNA Strand!

I was watching some YouTube video, saw an animation of a dna, and was inspired to re-create it with CSS. So here it is! My main challenge was to not animate properties like left, right, width, and height. Instead, I stuck to animating transforms.

This project was created with [Create New App](https://github.com/qodesmith/create-new-app).
